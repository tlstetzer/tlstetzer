					In The Mine! the player's goal is to earn as much money as possible. To do this the player must mine for gold and sell when gold prices are high. The game uses a side view and the player owns a mine with an elevator that can be sent to various levels. The player can dig through the soil removing block by block. When digging there are various surprises the player can encounter. The most important is of course gold, but others like impenetrable granite, cave-ins, easily dug-out sandstone and loose footings will also be encountered by the player.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of the mine the player can sell the gold he or she found. Gold prices fluctuate, so the player can try to find the best moment for selling. Each digging action the player undertakes costs money, so the player cannot wait too long or the mining operation will go bankrupt.

			<div class="card-header">Ouranos! Take the enemy by storm. (Currently in process)</div>
			<div class="card-body">
				<p class="text-center text-primary">Based on the Commodore Cursor magazine Ouranos! game by Kathy Higby</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					In this whimsical take on the artillery duel, two human players assume control of two rustic shacks, one on each side of the screen. Across the top wanders a lonely cloud, innocuous but full of hostile potential. Each turn the player gets to select a variety of weather -- Hail, Rain, Tornado or Lightning -- to inflict upon his or her opponent. Selecting a "charge" to assign the attack, based on the cloud's shifting location and a variable wind speed, the aggressor hopes to land a damaging strike upon their neighbour. The game is won when one side has successfully harnessed the forces of nature to completely dismantle the other's residence.
